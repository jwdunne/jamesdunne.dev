I grew up with ADHD.

I was one of the unlucky ones. It flew under the radar when I was at school.

I received my diagnosis at 25.

I felt anger at first. Towards the system, to those who punished me for daydreaming.

But that's the past - healthier to forgive and move on.

I'd already been in the industry for 5 years. I'd become a programmer despite (or because of) ADHD.

Medication helped. In fact, it was like rocket fuel. My job became so much easier with medication.

Along the way, I've developed coping strategies whilst working on, then leading and, today, growing a team of programmers.

## How do you learn to program with ADHD?

The first rule of programming with ADHD is:

**You must have a deep interest.**

The second rule of a programming with ADHD is:

**You must have a deep interest in programming.**

Otherwise, with ADHD, the process will be painful.￼

You might not know at first if it's deeply interesting. I didn't.

There's a lot of fluff out there. Dubious blog posts. Outdated, unreliable forum posts. Today, StackOverflow exists with higher quality.

When you're itching to do something useful, there's only so many toy examples you can take.

No matter how much you try, you are left mystified. *How do real programmers write code like that?*

Keep trying. Be a dog with a bone.

Something will click and the wonder of possibilities engulf you.

Then you'll feel like you can do anything.

And you will do. Badly.

You might even have the guts to apply for junior roles.

You'll fail again. Each rejection stings. But don't feel undeterred.

Keep trying. Ask for feedback.

In between, master the fundamentals.

## How do you learn the fundamentals of software development with ADHD?

- What are the fundamentals?
  - Data
  - Control
- Don't try reading Cormen or Knuth. It'll make you feel hopeless.
- Try these books instead:
- And check out these articles:
- But favour the practical. Practice makes perfect. Try these projects:
- Remember you have ADHD. It's okay to approach books and articles non-linear.
- Skip ahead to what sounds interesting if you get bored.
- Skip back a step if you struggle.

## How do you get into the industry with ADHD?

- I'm self-taught. For a junior in 2010, that outright removed a number of options.
- Early days, one colleague said I'd need a degree to work at IBM.
- Why tell me that? I don't wanna work at IBM.
- But if you do, first get relevant experience.
- The landscape has changed in 2021. The industry is starting to recognise there are excellent self-taught programmers who can outperform new graduates.

## How do you cope in industry with ADHD?

- ￼I recommend medication. It's not a silver bullet but it makes the day to day so much easier.
- Rule of thumb: the smaller the company, the more you have to self-manage
- The extreme case is startups. You don't want to do that on your first rodeo.
- Find somewhere small enough that will take self-taught programmers but big enough that you will have a senior developer to mentor you.
- But don't take that to mean you should hop when you feel you've learned everything you can from the senior.
- Why? Because you prevent yourself from learning from your own mistakes.

## How do you self-manage as programmer with ADHD?

- Self-management is difficult with ADHD.
- That's why having a deep interest in the craft is paramount.
- But don't let that fool you. Any day job comes with crap nobody likes doing.
- That's a unique self-management challenge for programmers with ADHD.
- With ADHD, you require external structure.
- The most basic form is a list.
- And, if you're like me, creating a linear list of steps is intimidating.
- Instead, use a mind map. I don't know why but mindmaps and tree-like structures make my brain work.
- Use those to breakdown a project into smaller layers of chunks.

## How do you manage medication whilst in work with ADHD?

### For those with medication

- Favour long-release medication.
- Methylphenidate typically lasts around 4 hours. Using that, you need to take it twice a work day.
- But with modified release, take it in the morning before work. It should last the work day.

### For the newly medicated

- If your starting a stimulant-based medication, be aware you're in for a wild few days.
- It might seem scary. Or euphoric. And perhaps the opposite of what you want.
- But it eases off and you settle into a new normal.
- Be mindful that your behavior may change, especially the first days.
- If you're uncomfortable feeling high at work, start on the weekend or book time off.

## How do you design a development workflow with ADHD?

### Use version control

- Start with version control. Every project should have it. I learned this the hard way. Now I cannot work without it.
- If joining a team with version control, adopt what they use.
- If your team doesn't use version control, advocate for it.
- In addition to being an indispensable and standard part of a professional development workflow, it provides the programmer with ADHD a harness.
- We may get carried away.
- Or we may get distracted.
- Using version control gives you a route back to baseline on false starts.
- Using branching and frequent commits protects your work from yourself.￼

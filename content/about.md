Hi. I'm James.

After a lucky break, I've spent the last ten years working in web and software
development. I used each project as a way to improve and learning something
new.

I also have ADHD. That injects more than a few challenges into my day to day
work. Especially routine, boring work. But through ruthless experimentation,
I've found ways to overcome those difficulties.

And I've suffered on and off from depression. That too presents serious
challenges as a developer. I've learned a good few things about those too.

And now I want to share my experiences with the world.

title: "Living with Mistakes"
draft: true

What do I want to say?

- Living with your mistakes is a powerful way to learn how to develop systems. 
- And greenfield developers suffer from myopia. 
- They optimise for getting it done, getting paid and moving on.
- They don't get to live with their long term mistakes. That cripples their experience, merely giving them 6 months experience multiplied by n projects. 
- And that manifests in choice of tech.
